My name is Tien Duy NGUYEN (Duy NG). I have 7 years of experience in backend engineering. I am currently a Senior at Ekino, specialized in Node.js, TypeScript and AWS.

At Ekino, I worked on Canal+, France's leading streaming platform. Strict requirements: performance, millions of users, multi-device, multiple countries. I learned: system architecture, production delivery, incident debugging, monitoring, performance, DevOps/CI-CD, team leadership.

I love learning new technologies and adapting quickly to project needs. This curiosity and agility allow me to always find solutions.

What defines me? I like to share my knowledge. On my GitHub (github.com/tduyng) and my website (tduyng.com), I publish articles and open source projects. To learn. To help others. This is how I stay curious and keep improving.

My previous employers have never regretted hiring me. And they were right to do so.

I also like to support team members. Create a good atmosphere. Working with me is easy. I am someone simple and open.

I like this culture: helping each other, improving together, learning from each other. This is what I am looking for in a company.

Now it is time for me to take on new challenges. Discover something else. Learn even more. I am ready to fully invest so you can say the same thing.
